    <h2> 
      Sometime around 2016 when the US was engrossed with the presidential elections, there was a distinct moment that sparked my conciousness of the Middle East.
      In an interview with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, the interviewer asked an innocuous question about the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo. Johnson replied with a befuddled expression 
      and uttured the now infamous words "What is Aleppo?". 
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Gary Johnson was incessantly mocked and ridiculed for his response. Many asked "How can we take a presidential nominee seriously if he doesn't know where Aleppo is".
      Back in 2016 I really wanted to join the chorus of jeers and mockery but the only problem was that I also didn't know what an Aleppo was either.
    </h2>
    <h2> 
      That example really serves as a microcosm of the perception that the general populus has about the Middle East. We understand that the US has a complex
      and important relationship with the region, but we don't have any cognition of why or how behind a surface level.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Most of our knowledge comes in the form of snapshots. Those snapshots may be humanitarian crises, terror organizations, negotiations, etc. But in totality those snapshots
      don't serve to create a broader narrative.
    </h2>

      This project intends to construct that narrative for a US audience. And at the end we can then answer two questions: "What is the future of the US in the Middle East" and also more self-referentially
      "How would a more conscious and complete US understanding of the Middle East change the dynamic".
