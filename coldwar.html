      It isn't a hyperbole to say the relationship between the US and the Middle East is less than a century old. That may seem odd
      when you consider how much has transpired in that century, but in reality the genesis of the modern relationship originates with the Cold War.
    </h2>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
      We can consider a single document to enumerate the aims, intentions, and policies of the US in the Middle East during the Cold War. That document would
      be "United States Objectives and Policies With Respect to the Near East" written by the National Security Council in 1954 sent to the then president
      Dwight D. Eisenhower.

    <h2>
      [1] A central aim of the United States in the Middle East was containment which was a political doctrine used to limit the spread of the USSR. The Middle East was in area that was off interest to the USSR given its proximity
      and consequently it became of interest to the United States. The language used in this document is often direct which makes sense given that the audience was the president. The US saw the Middle East as a potential battleground of
      the Cold War early on and worked to secure "strategic positions", create allies, and secure "passage rights".
    </h2>
    <h2>
      [2] The language of "stable, viable, and friendly governments" seems a bit offputting. One hand it makes sense in the context of "communist subversion": it seems like the connotation is that Communism is like a virus that affects sickly
      states. However, the word "viable" in this document seems to indicate that the US views these nations as ends to a mean, these "viable" states in the Middle East are states where the US can inject their own ideology.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      [3] Since its establishment in the 1940s Israel has always been a point of contention. And thus it makes sense that Israel was a major hurdle in the way of peace in the region. However, the US didn't solely intent to establish peace in Israel
      for general happiness and well-being in the region. Instead, having a nation like Israel planted firmly in the Middle East served as a way of exerting American influence in the region which was even more paramount to the state during the Cold
      War when the battle over the region was fierce. The document seems to suggest that when they mention that Israel could establish "order" in the region, almost like having Israel in the Middle East could keep a watchful eye over the rest of the
      region.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      [4] Anti-Americansm was a concept explored during the cold war where the battle of ideology reigned supreme. It's no big secret that the USA isn't viewed favorably by everyone, but during the Cold War especially the qualities of the US such as
      capitalism, individualism, imperalism directly challenged those of the USSR thus anti-American sentiment grew. Mending those relationships works to re-establish positive sentiments with states to make them less likely to fall victims to Communism.

      [5] When this objective states that the US has an aim of preventing the extension of Soviet influence they are making some concessions that this influence does exist. The Soviets were viewed as anti-imperialist by many states in the Middle East considering
      they overthrew their monarchy. Coupled with support against Israel many policies enacted by the US aimed to limit Soviet influence first before attempting to exert their own.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      [6] By promoting the idea of national sovereignty, the US hoped to gain the support of the newly independent countries in the Middle East and to counter Soviet influence in the region. The US also wanted these countries to take responsibility for their own development and to become more integrated with the free world. Overall, the aim was to establish a more stable and democratic Middle East that was aligned with US interests and values.
