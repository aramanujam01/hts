      Nobody really needs an executive summary about what oil is, or why it’s important. Oil runs the world for better or worse. The car you drive to work, the Amazon purchase you made last night, and the plastic that you used to put those leftovers away are all a product of oil. And we all know that the Middle East is important to oil, but how important:

      Oil has not always been a driving factor in the Middle East. In fact there is a definite transition from oil to non-oil in most of these states. Oil states in the Middle East are classified as Rentier states. Rentier States are states that derive most of their income from a form of rent (non tax related income).

          “access to rent has sustained governments in the region and has given them an unprecedented ability to control and direct their states. What this means for the future of the region is, however, controversial. Some political scientists argue that an overdependence upon rent is actually the
          Achilles heel of Middle Eastern governments.” (Gelvin).
