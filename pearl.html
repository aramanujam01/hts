    <h2> 
      What was life like in the Middle East before oil? We aren't that far removed from the pre-oil Middle Eastern economy.
      The transition to oil in the region was swift and drastic. One of the few remenants of a pre-oil society can be found
      in the story of Ahmad the Pearl Diver.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Ahmad was a Kuwaiti pearl diver who worked before the boon of oil in Kuwait. In those days, pearl diving was an economic mainstay which has now been demoted to a dying novelty.
      The story of Ahmad chronicles the story of a man who worked in sweltering heat, on pungent ships, working a mentally and physically exhausting job.

      <h4> Pearl divers in Kuwait</h4>
    </div>
    <h2>
      Ahmad worked for cents on the dollars, often earning just enough to pay back debts accrued from his profession. So one may ask what does Ahmad think about the economic revitilization of
      Kuwait. He must be elated that his sons don't have to be subjugated to harsh labor and can now simply enjoy the newfound wealth of oil.
    </h2>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>
          <h2>
            "Ahmad found the wealth and consumerism of Kuwait corrupting. He repeated time and again that his family had so many useless possessions and so much time on their hands that they were impossible for him to understand."
          </h2>
      </blockquote>
    </aside>
    <h2>
      It is important to understand that much like the modern oil-rich Middle East has values, the pre-oil region also had a set of values that were drastically differnt. The life that Ahmad lived was founded on duty, debt, and shared purpose.
    </h2>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>
          <h2>
            "They, however still saw value in what they did and their struggles gave them a sense of shared spirit with their fellow workers that is now lost."
          </h2>
      </blockquote>
    </aside> 
    <h2>
      The values in Ahmed's life were characterized by hard work and struggle. His whole employment was predicated on a debt his uncle owed which forced him into pearl diving. It is hard to look at his situation and not feel sympathy, but instead not
      only does Ahmed pity himself. He resents the modern Kuwait that has disposable income and social stratification. Why is that the case?
    </h2>
    <aside class="pquote">
      <blockquote>
        <h2>
          "Tribal ties defined the individual's status, obligations, and loyalties. (...) One obeyed the wqishes of the elite because they formed the most influential stratum of one's blood kin."
        </h2>
    </blockquote>  
    </aside>
    <h2> The concept of agency in the traditional western sense doesn't underpin Ahmad a Kuwaiti pearl diver. To him his job was his job, "inequality" wasn't concept because equality wasn't expected.
          Understanding this places us closer to Ahmad and the pre-oil Middle East, and one can see how the newfound excess and opportunity can be confusing to those who lived in a society where "opportunity" wasn't expected.
